Steamworks Wrappers
================

Steamworks API wrappers for various languages:

* C
* Delphi
* Java

Based on the [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) wrapper done by [Riley Labrecque](https://github.com/rlabrecque)

Notes
-----

You will need the compiled libraries (dll, so or dylib) for the wrapper. 
For convenience I'm providing here the pre-compiled binaries, in the bin folder.
For instructions how to compile them yourself check the [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) repository.

TODO
---------------------------------

Auto generate Delphi classes from each part of the Steamworks API.
Add Java headers.
